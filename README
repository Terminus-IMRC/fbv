  fbv - FrameBuffer Viewer

This is a simple program to view pictures on a framebuffer console.

We were just unable to find something doing the same thing in the Internet,
"If You need something - write it Yourself".. ;->

Instalation:
Read INSTALL.

Usage:
Just type "fbv" and a help message will appear.


Some code was based on fbset utility.
Image decoding engine uses libungif, libjpeg, libpng.

Big thanks for all You fb-contributors over there - great work!
