  fbv - FrameBuffer Viewer

A simple program to view pictures on a framebuffer console.

We were just unable to find something doing the same thing on the Internet,
"If You need something - write it Yourself".. ;->

Instalation:
Read INSTALL.

Usage:
Just type "fbv" and a help message will appear.


Some code was based on fbset utility.
Image decoding engine uses libungif, libjpeg, libpng.
BMP decoder was written from scratch by smoku.

Many thanks to all fb-contributors over there - great work guys!
